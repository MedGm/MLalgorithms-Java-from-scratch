# LinearRegression (Java)

This folder contains Java implementations of Linear Regression algorithms as part of the [MLalgorithms-Java-from-scratch](https://github.com/MedGm/MLalgorithms-Java-from-scratch) repository.

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement machine learning algorithms from scratch in Java, without using any external machine learning libraries. The focus here is on understanding the core concepts and mathematics behind each algorithm by building them step by step.

## Contents
- **LinearRegressionUniVar.java**: A simple univariate linear regression model (one input feature) using gradient descent.
- *(Coming soon)* Multivariable linear regression (multiple input features) and other linear regression variants.

## Goals
- Learn and demonstrate the fundamentals of linear regression.
- Provide clear, well-documented Java code for educational purposes.
- Expand to include more advanced linear regression techniques.

## Usage
Each Java class in this folder is self-contained and can be run independently. For example, to run the univariate linear regression:

```bash
javac LinearRegressionUniVar.java
java com.medgm.LinearRegression.LinearRegressionUniVar
```

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to add new linear regression variants or improve the existing code.
