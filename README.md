Hi! I'm an ML/DL enthusiast on a journey to learn and implement machine learning and deep learning algorithms in Java. This repository is my personal learning space where I explore, experiment, and share my understanding of how classic ML algorithms work—by building them from scratch in Java. No external ML libraries, just pure code and curiosity!

## Why This Repo?
I created this project to deepen my own understanding of machine learning concepts and to document my learning process. By implementing algorithms step by step, I aim to demystify the math and logic behind them. If you're also learning or just curious about how ML works under the hood, I hope my code and notes help you too.

## What's Inside?
- Each folder will contain a Java implementation of a specific ML algorithm.
- No external dependencies—just Java.
- Focused on clarity, learning, and having fun with code.
- Currently, there's a `LinearRegression` folder with my implementation of univariate linear regression (`LinearRegressionUniVar.java`).
- More folders and Java classes for other algorithms will be added as I learn and grow!

## Folder Structure
- `LinearRegression/`  
    Contains univariate linear regression (`LinearRegressionUniVar.java`)
- *(More folders for other algorithms coming soon as I continue learning)*

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/MedGm/MLalgorithms-Java-from-scratch.git
     ```
2. Go to the folder of the algorithm you want to try (e.g., LinearRegression).
3. Compile and run the Java files using your favorite IDE or the command line.

Example for univariate linear regression:
```bash
cd LinearRegression
javac LinearRegressionUniVar.java
java LinearRegression.LinearRegressionUniVar
```
